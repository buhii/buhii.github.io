      <h2>A Short List of Sources I Use</h2>
<p>In this article, I will share my go-to sources for information gathering. While most of them are software-engineering-related, I will also list miscellaneous ones. I would like to know your similar sources as well.</p>

<h3>Hacker News</h3>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> is a website that I visit every day. Since Y Combinator runs it, the majority of the posts are software-related. However, I enjoy reading articles and comments unrelated to my work, such as science-oriented or vintage computing topics. Of course, I have experienced several times that what I learned here has been helpful in my career.</p>
<h3>Twitter</h3>
<p>I'm always surprised by the real-time tweets from many superstars active in machine learning or software engineering. Some people are leaving Twitter for other platforms, such as Mastodon, but I haven't considered making the switch yet. Since I don't own my TV, I also follow local news here.</p>
<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>
<p>I subscribe to mailing lists such as <a href="https://thegradient.pub/">The Gradient</a>, <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/">The Batch</a>, or <a href="https://www.weeklyrobotics.com/">Weekly Robotics</a>. Some of them also offer podcasts. I also subscribe to <a href="https://www.nime.org/list/">NIME</a>, which is related to the computer music field.</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>Most of the time, I go to libraries for a change of pace without any particular objective. As a result, I often browse bookshelves that are outside of my specialty and choose books randomly. On the other hand, if I'm searching for a specific text, I usually go to bookstores. I sometimes also go to used ones.</p>
<h3>Shazam</h3>
<p>I often use Shazam to look up songs playing while I walk around town or at restaurants. Since I subscribe to Apple Music, I can easily find most of the songs (Shazam is operated by Apple, so that's not surprising).</p>
