        Welcome to Takahiro Kamatani's home page. I am a software engineer living in Tokyo.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm passionate about the intersection of art and technology and have extensive experience working on various new media artworks, including software and hardware components.

    <p>
        Python and <a href="https://cycling74.com/products/max">Max (Cycling '74)</a> are my favorite programming languages. I often enjoy walking around Tokyo and also soldering in my free time.
