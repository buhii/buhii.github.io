## Hello World

I have decided to restart my blog after a few years of absence.

My old website ran on Google App Engine for about ten years. Because some services are no longer needed and are harder to maintain, I have decided to switch to my boring static site generator. I am considering migrating my old articles, but I will need more time to complete this task.

I plan to write my articles in both English and Japanese for practice. While writing in English is still challenging, services like Grammarly, DeepL, and ChatGPT have made it much easier. Regardless, I'm sloppy and might stop writing in two languages halfway though.

I enjoy reading various blogs and hope to write something someone will find engaging.
